Here's the point: I am essentially creating this entire application using AI, including this text, which has been rewritten for clarity, by Bing. This application is a general-purpose taxonomy and Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed for supervised learning language applications. It leverages taxonomically-ensured safe applications of generative AI. Additionally, it may incorporate a basic form of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern.

For functioning in a time space reality, the past is the present, as we see it now. Anything can be a one-shot learning if it really matters.

That is an interesting perspective. One-shot learning is a technique that allows a machine learning model to learn from a single example of a new class, rather than requiring a large amount of labeled data. One-shot learning is useful for tasks such as face recognition, where it is impractical to collect many images of each person. One-shot learning can also be seen as a way of transferring knowledge from previously learned classes to new ones, by using shared features or model parameters. ¹²

One possible application of one-shot learning is to create a system that can recognize any object in a time space reality, given only one image of it. This would require a model that can extract the essential features of the object, and compare them with a database of known objects. The model would also need to account for variations in lighting, viewpoint, and occlusion. Such a system could be very useful for exploring new environments, or identifying rare or unknown phenomena. ³
